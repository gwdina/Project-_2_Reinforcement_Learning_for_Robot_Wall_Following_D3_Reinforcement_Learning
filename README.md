# Project-_2_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Robot_Wall_Following_D3_Reinforcement_Learning
Start up a Gazebo simulation and runs a maze map, a robot will use Q-Learning to follow the walls of the maze through the use of lidar sensors, and will build a Q-Table from its trials in order to follow the walls

The video shows the use of the completed Q-table.

Access to Gazebo, the worlds used, and other things for this project can be obtained from a request, please email gwdina@gmail.com
The files size and complexity can not be uploaded to GitHub at the current time
